desc: panelling and antique furniture make it the perfect place for its
desc: honoured users to relax in the style to which they are justly
desc: entitled. To find exits type exits.
Room object 4: 0=store all=store hide hideaway
name: Wizards' storeroom.
desc: The immensity of this room is enough to fill any mortal with awe and
desc: insignificance, but you are naturally unimpressed. This is the room
desc: used by wizards as a store for things to be dumped at random out on
desc: the poor unsuspecting adventurers to add a bit of spice to the game.
Room object 5: 0=limbo all=limbo light hideaway nolook silent
name: Limbo.
desc: Everything around you is a glowing white, and there are no walls you
desc: can focus on. You feel as if you are floating on air. You are.
Room object 6: 0=xmasbx all=xmasbx light death hide hideaway sanctuary
name: Christmas box.
desc: This room is for the benefit only of those wizards and witches who
desc: want to make Christmas a nice time of year. Use no other season, please!

Room object 7: 0=bank1 all=bank1 light
name: Bank of river.
desc: You are stood on the grassy, west bank of a fast-flowing river. The
desc: river flows from the north to the south, where can be seen a ford
desc: across it. To the west you can see a tumble-down stable, and in the
desc: distance north of that, mountains. On the opposite bank of the river
desc: is dense forest.
Room object 8: 0=bank2 all=bank2 light
name: %bank1
desc: This is the west bank of a river, which flows north to south very
desc: quickly. The opposite bank is forested, but here the ground is clear.
desc: To the northwest rise the steep slopes of a tall mountain, its peak
desc: towering high above the clouds.
Room object 9: 0=bank3 all=bank3 light
name: %bank1
desc: This is a narrow strip of land wedged between a fast-flowing river to
desc: the east, and a (climbable) mountain to the west. The river cuts its
desc: way north-south, and makes quite some noise. You can't see much of what
desc: the landscape on the opposite bank is like for the trees there.
Room object 10: 0=bank4 all=bank4 light
name: %bank1
desc: You find yourself on the bank of a fast-flowing river, where the
desc: heath to the west is parted from the forest on the opposite bank. The
desc: river flows from the north, and continues to the south, cutting off a
desc: narrow strip of land trapped between it and the steep mountain you spy
desc: to the southwest.
Room object 11: 0=bank5 all=bank5 light
name: %bank1
desc: Flowing from the northeast and curving viciously to the south is a
desc: fast-flowing river, upon the banks of which you now find yourself
desc: situated. On the opposite bank are trees, although the river is too
desc: quick to enable your swimming across. To the north is a curious, ornate
desc: wall, decorated in exotic, colourful designs of seemingly eastern
desc: origin. The wall is too tall to climb, as is the enormous hedge you find
desc: to the west, over the top of which you can just see what looks to be a
desc: belfry. The hedge stops on the edge of some trees, which are clumped
desc: together to the southwest.
Room object 12: 0=belfry all=belfry small
name: Inside belfry.
desc: You find yourself at the bottom of a belfry stood in a forest clearing.
desc: Outside, to the east the way is blocked by a huge hedge, and to the
desc: north is an ornate wall, decorated in colourful, oriental friezes.
desc: Elsewhere is more forest. The tower of the belfry rises high above
desc: you, but you can't climb the walls.
Room object 13: 0=briar all=briar light
name: Briar patch.
desc: You are gingerly pushing your way through a prickly briar patch,
desc: skillfully avoiding being scratched from the many thorns about. To
desc: the north runs an east-west road, and to the east is a yard outside
desc: an old inn. South lies pasture, beyond which is a river, and west are
desc: the foothills of a majestic mountain, spearing its way through the
desc: fluffy clouds.
Room object 14: 0=bridge all=bridge light
name: Bridge over river.
desc: You are crossing a narrow, wooden bridge over a fast-flowing river.
desc: To the west lie the dark oaks of an evil wood, with the noise made by
desc: the river only adding to the eerie effect of their hideous shadows. At
desc: the eastern end of the bridge is a small island, bereft of trees, yet
desc: looking quite lush compared to the fearsome dark of the forest.
Room object 15: 0=dead1 all=dead1 light death
name: Did you think you could fly? Sorry if I gave that impression...
Room object 16: 0=dead2 all=dead2 light death
name: You jump up and down, but the extra force is too much for the part
desc: of the swamp where you stand, and to your horror you find yourself
desc: being sucked under! Well that's something not to try again, eh?
Room object 17: 0=dead3 all=dead3 light death
name: The volatile marsh gases catch light from your naked flame, and before
desc: you know it, #WHOOMSH#...
Room object 18: 0=efrst1 all=efrst1 light
name: Dense forest.
desc: You are wandering around in some dense forest on the west bank of a
desc: fast-flowing river. To the north, the river is crossed by a ford, and
desc: to the south it runs beside a meadow, beyond which you can see what
desc: looks like a belvedere of some kind. At that point the river splits,
desc: and curves round to the southwest of where you stand. West, the forest
desc: seems to be primarily of fruit trees, and northwest through the greenery
desc: you can see what looks like a well.
Room object 19: 0=epstre all=epstre light
name: East pasture.
desc: You are standing in lush pasture, irrigated by a river which curves from
desc: being to the east round to the north and continuing west of there to the
desc: northwest of where you stand. The pasture carries on to the west and
desc: southwest, but south is some rougher pasture which isn't so good.
Room object 20: 0=ewd1 all=ewd1 light
name: Evil wood.
desc: You are wandering around in among the hideously deformed oaks of an evil
desc: wood. To the north and east runs a river, and west is a rough pasture.
desc: The wood gets thicker to the south, where it continues in an almost
desc: impenetrable darkness...
Room object 21: 0=ewd2 all=ewd2 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are forcing your way through the ancient, misshapen oaks which make
desc: up an evil wood. The only ways out which do not involve continuing
desc: into the denseness of the trees are to the north and west. Otherwise,
desc: the darkness envelops...
Room object 22: 0=ewd3 all=ewd3 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are thrusting your way through a mangled assortment of aged oak
desc: trees which are part of an evil wood. Northwards, the trees give way to
desc: a rough pasture, and to the easterly directions they continue in the
desc: same density as here. Other directions, however, the forest becomes too
desc: thick for you to force your way through...
Room object 23: 0=ewd4 all=ewd4 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are in the midst of an evil wood, surrounded by gnarled oaks of
desc: ancient origin. The forest continues all around you, in a darkness
desc: which seems unnatural, although to the south and southwest it appears
desc: too thick to move through...
Room object 24: 0=ewd5 all=ewd5 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are in the depths of a murky, evil wood, its gloomy oaks seeming to
desc: stare down at you as though watching your every movement. All around,
desc: the forest continues, although in the southerly directions it appears
desc: too thick to enable passage...
Room object 25: 0=ewd6 all=ewd6 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are in an evil wood, on the west bank of a fast-flowing river. The
desc: malformed oaks which enclose the area loom over you, throwing the whole
desc: place into deep shadow. The wood continues in all directions except the
desc: east, where the river runs, although to the south it is too dense for
desc: you to venture that way...
Room object 26: 0=ewd7 all=ewd7 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are in the middle of an evil wood, built up over many centuries from
desc: a ghastly assortment of wizened oaks, twisted into a tangled
desc: conglomeration. The forest continues in all directions...
Room object 27: 0=ewd8 all=ewd8 light
name: %ewd1
desc: This is part of an evil wood, on the west bank of a fast-flowing river.
desc: The knotted, wicked-looking oaks continue in the south and westerly
desc: directions, but other ways is the river. Through the trees, to the east,
desc: can be seen a small bridge which spans the river to an island in mid-
desc: stream...
Room object 28: 0=ewd9 all=ewd9 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are pushing your way through the forlorn branches of some ancient
desc: oaks in the middle of an evil wood. All around, the wood continues, its
desc: oppressive gloom enveloping the entire scene...
Room object 29: 0=ewd10 all=ewd10 light
name: %ewd1
desc: You are stood in the very heart of an evil wood, its intense blackness
desc: and eerie silence casting fear into your soul. The dense, warped oaks
desc: carry on in all directions, and their thick branches obscure the sky
desc: from view...
Room object 30: 0=gazebo all=gazebo light small silent
name: Inside gazebo.
desc: This is an ornate and elegant gazebo, built on a small eminence to
desc: afford a better prospect of the surrounding countryside. North can
desc: be seen a lush meadow, beyond which is a forest, and further still
desc: a mountain. East is a fast-flowing river, which splits in two and
desc: curves from the north round to the west, as well as continuing to the
desc: south. Over the river can be seen forest, although south the trees are
desc: of a hideous, misshapen form.
Room object 31: 0=heath1 all=heath1 light
name: Rough heath.
desc: You are striding across a rough heath, between a forest in the north
desc: and a mountain to the south. East is the bank of a river, and west the
desc: heath continues. Through the trees to the north can be glimpsed a
desc: small tower of some kind.
Room object 32: 0=heath2 all=heath2 light
name: %heath1
desc: You are walking across a rough heath, which continues to the east, west
desc: and southwest. South is the base of a large mountain, the peak of which
desc: is partly obscured by the clouds which flank it some way up. North from
desc: here is mainly forest, although in the distance to the northwest is an
desc: enormous mountain, more majestic than the other.
Room object 33: 0=heath3 all=heath3 light
name: %heath1
desc: This is a band of rough heathland, which curves from the south to
desc: continue to the east. Southeast lies the base of a large mountain, but
desc: northwest are the foothills of one even larger, and far more majestic.
desc: North is forest, through which can be espied an ornate wall.
Room object 34: 0=heath4 all=heath4 light
name: %heath1
desc: You are scrambling over a rough heath, which rises out of a deep valley
desc: to the south and carries on to the north and northeast. East is the
desc: bottom of a large mountain, and west lie the foothills of an even
desc: greater peak. The ground here is very awkward to walk on, but you can
desc: keep your footing without too much trouble.
Room object 35: 0=inn all=inn light
name: Inside the "Admiral Bombow" inn.
desc: You stand inside what used to be a cheery, hospitable tavern, which has
desc: now unfortunately fallen into a state of gross disrepair. All the
desc: windows have long since been smashed, and now only a howling wind
desc: whistles through where once there was warmth and light.
Room object 36: 0=island all=island light
name: Small island.
desc: You are stood on a small island in the middle of a fast-flowing river.
desc: The only exit is via a bridge to the west, which crosses the river into
desc: a dark, evil wood. The island itself, mysteriously enough, has no trees,
desc: but apart from that there is plenty of vegetation.
Room object 37: 0=meadow all=meadow light
name: Riverside meadow.
desc: You are strolling through a pleasant meadow on the west bank of a fast-
desc: flowing river. The river splits further to the south, and one branch
desc: meanders northwards to end up to the west of where you stand. North
desc: is a forest, and northwest a more cultivated section which seems to be
desc: an orchard. South, by the fork in the river, stands a gazebo.
Room object 38: 0=mmtn1 all=mmtn1 light
name: Middle mountain.
desc: You are on the north face of a steep, yet climbable, mountain. Above
desc: you to the south the slopes rise into the clouds, and poking out
desc: through the top you espy the peak. The mountain continues at this level
desc: to the southeast and southwest, whereas northwards is heathland.
Room object 39: 0=mmtn2 all=mmtn2 light
name: %mmtn1
desc: This is the west face of a steep mountain. The summit lies beyond a
desc: mantle of cloud which encircles the mountain just above you. Southwards
desc: and to the northeast the mountain continues at this level, but to the
desc: southwest it descends into a deep valley. North and west lie heaths,
desc: and beyond them the mighty slopes of another mountain.
Room object 40: 0=mmtn3 all=mmtn3 light
name: %mmtn1
desc: You are clambering about the southwest face of the Middle mountain.
desc: Just above you, to the northeast, lie clouds hugging the slopes and
desc: obscuring the summit. The mountain continues at roughly your present
desc: altitude to the north and east, but to the west the gradient increases
desc: dramatically and plunges into a deep valley. Southwards is a badly-paved
desc: road running east to west, and beyond that to the southeast is another
desc: mountain thrusting above the clouds.
Room object 41: 0=mmtn4 all=mmtn4 light
name: %mmtn1
desc: This is a steep, yet thankfully climbable, mountain. The present height
desc: above sea level is maintained to the west and northeast, but to the
desc: north the mountain rises into the clouds and beyond. To the east you can
desc: see a stable, and further still, a deep river. To the south is a badly-
desc: paved road running east-west, on the opposite side of which there is an
desc: inn.
Room object 42: 0=mmtn5 all=mmtn5 light
name: %mmtn1
desc: You are now scaling the rugged east face of the middle mountain.
desc: Although steep, it is still possible to ascend (into the mists which
desc: drape the mountain beneath the peak) and descend (onto the banks of a
desc: river to the east). At the same altitude, the mountain continues to the
desc: northwest and southwest, and ceases to the south where is nestled a
desc: ramshackle old stable.
Room object 43: 0=mmtn6 all=mmtn6 light
name: Misty part of middle mountain.
Room object 44: 0=mmtn7 all=mmtn7 light
name: %mmtn6
Room object 45: 0=mmtn8 all=mmtn8 light
name: %mmtn6
Room object 46: 0=mmtn9 all=mmtn9 light
name: %mmtn6
Room object 47: 0=mmtn10 all=mmtn10 light
name: Top of middle mountain.
desc: The marvellous panoramic view this spot affords is breath-taking in its
desc: splendour. Lower down the mountain, beyond the wreaths of cloud which
desc: circle this peak, are heaths to the north, beyond which is forest. To
desc: the east at the bottom can be seen a fast-flowing river, running from
desc: the north to diverge some way south, by a meadow. South, there is an
desc: old inn close by an east-west road, and southwest is another mountain.
desc: The scene is dominated, however, by a third mountain to the northwest,
desc: so immense that it dwarfs either of the other two. Its ancient slopes
desc: are shrouded in mist, with rugged cliffs running for hundreds of feet
desc: just below.
Room object 48: 0=nfrst1 all=nfrst1 light
name: %efrst1
desc: You are wandering around in some dense forest. East, the forest
desc: continues, and to the south lie heathlands. West are the foothills of a
desc: majestic mountain, which towers high up above the clouds. Your progress
desc: north is blocked by an ornate wall, decorated in exotic, eastern
desc: patterns, which stops at the base of an enormous cliff at roughly the
desc: same spot the forest ends to the west.
Room object 49: 0=nfrst2 all=nfrst2 light
name: %efrst1
desc: You find yourself stood in a section of dense forest, which continues to
desc: the west and southeast. Through the trees to the east can be seen the
desc: tower of what looks to be a belfry, and south is heath. Northwards is
desc: a strange, ornate wall, curiously enlivened by all manner of stylised
desc: eastern symbols.
Room object 50: 0=nfrst3 all=nfrst3 light
name: %efrst1
desc: You are wandering around in some dense forest to the north of some
desc: sprawling heathlands. Eastwards is the bank of a fast-flowing river,
desc: and northwest the forest continues. To the north, however, through the
desc: trees, can be seen a clearing containing some sort of edifice.
Room object 51: 0=nhill1 all=nhill1 light
name: Foothills.
desc: These are the rolling foothills of a majestic mountain which towers
desc: high above you some way to the north, beyond some higher foothills.
desc: South is an east-west road, across which can be seen yet more foothills
desc: of a slightly smaller mountain. East lies a deep valley, which rises up
desc: into a heath to the northeast of where you stand. West is a sturdy wall,
desc: too large to scale.
Room object 52: 0=nhill2 all=nhill2 light
name: %nhill1
desc: You are stood amongst the foothills of a majestic mountain, which rises
desc: to the north. South and northeast are more foothills, and east lies a
desc: heath. Your movement west is prevented by a large wall, built to repel
desc: intruders such as yourself.
Room object 53: 0=nhill3 all=nhill3 light
name: %nhill1
desc: You are clambering about the foothills of a majestic mountain which
desc: climbs above the clouds to the north. Unfortunately, there is a towering
desc: cliff there, too large to ascend, but part of the mountain, to the west,
desc: is accessible. Southwest lie further foothills, and southeast is all
desc: heath. Northeast is a forest.
Room object 54: 0=nmtn1 all=nmtn1 light
name: Forested part of north mountain.
desc: You are stood in amongst some trees which cloak the lower slopes of a
desc: majestic mountain, rising to the north above the timber-line. West, the
desc: forest becomes too dense for you to proceed, and south is a wall, also
desc: blocking your way. All other directions, the mountain continues,
desc: although southeast is only foothills.
Room object 55: 0=nmtn2 all=nmtn2 light
name: North mountain.
desc: You are scaling the lower slopes of a majestic mountain. Its peak lies
desc: high above the clouds far to the north, although progress that way is
desc: only limited due to an interposing cliff which stands out boldly after
desc: some more climbable slopes. South are foothills.
Room object 56: 0=nmtn3 all=nmtn3 light
name: %nmtn2
desc: You are standing in the lower slopes of a majestic mountain, which
desc: rises to the north and descends to the east and south into foothills.
Room object 57: 0=nmtn4 all=nmtn4 light
name: %nmtn2
desc: You are scrambling up the slopes of a majestic mountain which spears
desc: through the clouds far to the north, above a steep cliff. East lie
desc: foothills, and there are lower slopes to the south. The sheer
desc: immensity of the mountain takes your breath away.
Room object 58: 0=nmtn5 all=nmtn5 light
name: %nmtn2
desc: You are stood in the lower slopes of a majestic mountain beside a
desc: huge cliff to the north, which towers high above you. So rugged is the
desc: cliff that you cannot climb it, only gasp at the geological wonder of
desc: it all. The mountain slopes downwards to the south, and continues at the
desc: same level to the west.
Room object 59: 0=nmtn6 all=nmtn6 light
name: %nmtn2
desc: You are in the corner of a horseshoe-shaped cliff, which curves round
desc: from the north to the west, blocking your way. All around you in other
desc: directions lie the slopes leading up to the cliff, which towers high
desc: above you, ending just below the clouds.
Room object 60: 0=nmtn7 all=nmtn7 light
name: %nmtn2
desc: You are ascending the lower slopes of a majestic mountain, which
desc: forces its way through the clouds further to the north, above a rugged
desc: cliff beyond where the slopes end. The cliff curves round, and blocks
desc: your immediate passage to the west, although in other directions the
desc: comparatively gentle slopes lead down to the foothills.
Room object 61: 0=nmtn8 all=nmtn8 light
name: %nmtn2
desc: You are climbing the slopes of a majestic mountain, which continue to
desc: rise awesomely in the northern and western directions, and descend less
desc: spectacularly to the south and east.
Room object 62: 0=npstre all=npstre light
name: North pasture.
desc: You are treading over the soft grass of a gorgeous pasture. To the north
desc: is a river, which continues to the northeast and flows beneath a
desc: mountain to the northwest. East, west and south, the pasture continues,
desc: yet to the southeast it becomes much rougher and more desolate. To the
desc: southwest lies forest.
Room object 63: 0=orchrd all=orchrd light
name: Ancient orchard.
desc: You stand among the aged trees of an orchard. Most of them are apple
desc: trees, but there is the occasional pear tree to add character. None
desc: bear fruit or leaves, however, which makes the scene unnaturally
desc: desolate. East and west from here are normal forests, and southeast is a
desc: sweet meadow. South and southwest is a river, and north is a yard,
desc: beyond which is an inn.
Room object 64: 0=pines1 all=pines1 light
name: Pine forest.
desc: You are pushing your way through the pine needles in a dense forest.
desc: Eastwards, the make-up of the forest changes to normal, deciduous trees.
desc: Northeast is a pasture, and north can be smelled a fuming swamp. In all
desc: other directions the pines get thicker, and you probably won't be able
desc: to get through.
Room object 65: 0=river1 all=river1 light death hideaway
name: You have left The Land.
Room object 66: 0=river2 all=river2 light
name: Fast-flowing river.
desc: You are wading through a fast-flowing, yet shallow, river, which
desc: originates from a fork in a much faster river to the southeast, and
desc: continues to the northwest. North is an orchard, which by the northeast
desc: has become a normal forest. East is a meadow, south of which is a
desc: gazebo. To the west lies a lush pasture, but southwest it is rough and
desc: desolate.
Room object 67: 0=river3 all=river3 light
name: %river2
desc: This is a river flowing from the southeast to the west. On the south
desc: bank lie exclusively pastures, and on the north, forest. The forest
desc: directly to the north seems to be an orchard of some kind, and through
desc: the trees there can be seen a building.
Room object 68: 0=river4 all=river4 light
name: %river2
desc: You are stood by a river, flowing from the east to the west, where it
desc: disappears under a mountain. Foothills of the mountain are to the
desc: northwest, covered in forest which extends to the north of your current
desc: position, and become an orchard to the northeast. In all southerly
desc: directions are pastures of soft, deep-green grass.
Room object 69: 0=road1 all=road1 light
name: Badly-paved road.
desc: You are stood on a badly-paved road between a mountain, to the north,
desc: and a wayside inn, to the south. East, the road fords a fast-flowing
desc: river, and west it continues. To the northeast is a ramshackle old
desc: building, and southeast there seems to be a well of some kind.
Room object 70: 0=road2 all=road2 light
name: %road1
desc: You find yourself on a badly-paved road, which continues to the east and
desc: west. North and northeast are the lower regions of a mountain, which
desc: rises up beyond the clouds. Southeast is a yard, belonging to an inn
desc: which can be seen just beyond it. South is a briar patch, and southwest
desc: the foothills of a more impressive mountain. Northwest is a deep valley,
desc: whose western slopes rise up to the foothills of a mountain more
desc: majestic still. The view is quite breathtaking.
Room object 71: 0=road3 all=road3 light
name: %road1
desc: You are walking along a badly-paved east-west road. From here can be
desc: seen three mountains: one to the northeast; one to the south and south-
desc: west; and one to the northwest, which is the largest. To the north,
desc: between two of the mountains, lies a deep valley. The only other nearby
desc: feature is a briar patch to the southeast.
Room object 72: 0=road4 all=road4 light
name: %road1
desc: You are stood on a badly-paved road, which runs from the east to stop
desc: at a large wall constructed to the west. There is a narrow gap in this
desc: blockage, but it is so tight that if you wanted to go that way you'd
desc: have to drop everything to get through. North and south are the foot-
desc: hills of a pair of majestic mountains, and northeast is a deep valley.
Room object 73: 0=rough all=rough light
name: Rough pasture.
desc: You are stood in a bleak, rough pasture. This seems to be due to the
desc: presence of an evil wood to the east and south, for north and west are
desc: more pastures which seem to be far greener and lusher than here. South-
desc: west is a forest, and northeast there seems to be a fast-flowing river.
Room object 74: 0=sfrst1 all=sfrst1 light
name: %efrst1
desc: You are standing in a dense forest. It continues to the southeast at
desc: a passable level, but south it is too thick to allow movement through.
desc: Westwards it becomes a pine forest. North, northeast and east are
desc: pastures, and northwest lies a festering, fuming swamp.
Room object 75: 0=sfrst2 all=sfrst2 light
name: %efrst1
desc: This is a forest, to the south of a pasture. The trees continue in most
desc: directions, but only to the northwest are they thinly spread enough to
desc: enable your walking through. Northwest is another pasture, but rougher
desc: than the first.
Room object 76: 0=shill1 all=shill1 light
name: %nhill1
desc: You are stood in among the foothills of a majestic mountain to the
desc: south. North is a narrow road which runs east-west, and everywhere else
desc: is more mountain. Your progress to the west is impeded by a strong wall,
desc: built to keep out trespassers.
Room object 77: 0=shill2 all=shill2 light
name: %nhill1
desc: You are standing in the foothills of a tall mountain, which rises away
desc: to the southwest. North is a badly-paved road, which runs east-west, and
desc: east is a briar patch. There are more foothills to the west, and to the
desc: south are forested slopes of the mountain.
Room object 78: 0=smtn1 all=smtn1 light
name: South mountain.
desc: You are clambering around the slopes of a tall mountain, which rises up
desc: to the northeast into the clouds. North and east the mountain is at the
desc: same level as here, and to the southeast it slops down into a gentle
desc: pasture. Southwest is a swamp, fuming with marsh-gases, and west is the
desc: top of a tall cliff, which looks very dangerous...
Room object 79: 0=smtn2 all=smtn2 light
name: %smtn1
desc: This is a steep climb at the base of a tall mountain. Further heights
desc: are to the west and northeast at this level (the latter area covered in
desc: forest), and north and northwest where the clouds hug the slopes. The
desc: mountain lowers slowly in the southerly directions to become pastures.
desc: East, a river flows and disappears under the mountain beneath where you
desc: now stand.
Room object 80: 0=smtn3 all=smtn3 light
name: Forested part of south mountain.
desc: Your are stood amongst the trees in the forested slopes of the south
desc: mountain. There is more forest to the east, and the mountain ascends to
desc: the west, its peak hidden from view by the clouds near the top. North
desc: are foothills, and northeast a briar patch. Southeast flows a river.
Room object 81: 0=smtn4 all=smtn4 light

Room object 84: 0=smtn7 all=smtn7 light
name: %smtn1
desc: You are on a steep slope to the west of a tall mountain. The mountain
desc: continues in all directions, although to the east you can see nothing
desc: for the clouds, and to the west there is a large wall in the way.
Room object 85: 0=smtn8 all=smtn8 light
name: %smtn4
Room object 86: 0=smtn9 all=smtn9 light
name: Top of south mountain
desc: You are standing at the very peak of the south mountain. A glorious
desc: view is to be beheld all around. To the northeast is a mountain, on
desc: the opposite side of a road from some building. To the north is a third
desc: mountain much larger than either of the other two, and far more
desc: majestic. South lie pastures, and southeast is an evil-looking wood,
desc: hard up against the side of a river, in which can be seen a small
desc: island. West, over a wall just visible through the clouds, is a strange,
desc: anachronistic world, centred around a house.
Room object 87: 0=spstre all=spstre light
name: South pasture.
desc: This is a pleasant pasture, which spreads far away in all the northerly
desc: directions; eastwards, it becomes rougher. There is forest everywhere
desc: else.
Room object 88: 0=swamp1 all=swamp1 light hideaway sanctuary nolook dmove uswamp
name: You are waylaid in a fuming swamp.
Room object 89: 0=stable all=stable
name: Stable.
desc: This ramshackle old stone building is what is left of a once proud
desc: stable. It has sadly fallen into disrepair, due to the constant
desc: battering of the elements, nestled as it is to the southeast of a
desc: towering mountain. To the east is a river bank, the river running
desc: north-south and forded to the southeast of where you now stand. To
desc: the southwest, running west from the ford, is a badly-paved road,
desc: beside which is an inn, the patrons of which stabled their horses here
desc: before The Land became what it is today.
Room object 90: 0=start all=start light startrm
name: Ford across river.
desc: You are stood on a ford across a fast-flowing river. To the west is a
desc: badly-paved road, which carries on into the distance. Northwest is a
desc: ramshackle old building, and southwest is some sort of well. South lies
desc: a forest, and north is the west bank of the river you now cross. The
desc: east bank leads away, out of The Land.
Room object 91: 0=uswamp all=uswamp light death sanctuary
name: Bottom of swamp.
desc: If you can read this, you used magic!
Room object 92: 0=valley all=valley light
name: Valley between mountains.
desc: This is a beautiful and awesome sight. You are stood in a deep valley,
desc: carved between two tall mountains, to the west and east, eons ago. The
desc: steep slopes are barely climbable, and abound in curious fauna and
desc: strange, half-shadowed creatures. South, outside the valley, is an
desc: east-west road, and north is heathland. This place is very eerie.
Room object 93: 0=wayout all=wayout light nolook chain mud start
name: You force yourself through the narrow gap...
Room object 94: 0=wellrm all=wellrm light
name: Well near inn.
desc: You stand beside what used to be a well, but which on closer inspection
desc: seems to be blocked off now. West is an inn, for which the well was
desc: probably originally constructed, although some way to the east can be
desc: heard running water. North is an east-west road, and southwest an
desc: orchard of mainly apple trees. Southeast is dense forest.
Room object 95: 0=wfrst1 all=wfrst1 light
name: %efrst1
desc: This is dense forest, at the bottom of a majestic mountain to the west.
desc: The trees continue up the mountain, and there is an orchard to the east.
desc: North is a briar patch, and south is an east-west flowing river. To the
desc: Northeast is a yard adjacent to an old inn.
Room object 96: 0=wpstre all=wpstre light
name: West pasture.
desc: This is a pasture which sprawls at the feet of a majestic mountain to
desc: the north. The pasture continues to the east and southeast, but south
desc: and southwest are forests. West, the pasture ends beside a fuming swamp.
Room object 97: 0=yard1 all=yard1 light
name: Side yard of inn.
desc: This is a narrow yard at the western side of an inn. North is a badly-
desc: paved raod, and west a briar patch. Southeast, the yard becomes the back
desc: yard of the inn.
Room object 98: 0=yard2 all=yard2 light
name: Back yard of inn.
desc: This is a wide yard to the south of an old tavern, and continues to the
desc: side of it to the northwest. South is an orchard, and southwest is a
desc: forest. To the east there seems to be a well, near the inn.
