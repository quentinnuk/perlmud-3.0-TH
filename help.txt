*beginner
Welcome to PerlMUD. PerlMUD is very similar to TinyMUD
and TeenyMUD, with which you may be familiar. 

If you are new to MUDs, you will want to read the 
following topics first:

clothing
moving
talking
topics
email

Type "help clothing" to read that topic.
*email
On some PerlMUD systems, you can receive mail at the site
the MUD runs on if you use the @email command to set an
address to which your mail should be forwarded. This means
your fellow MUD users don't have to remember your
email address. See @email for details.
*@email
If you wish to make it easier for other users to contact
you by email, use the @email command to tell the system
where email for you should be forwarded. Once you do this,
other users can contact you by sending email to
yourmudname@mudcomputer.com instead of remembering
your address.

Example (for the player "bob"):
@email boba@foo.com
Email address set.

Bob's friends can now reach him by sending mail
to bob@baz.com, if the MUD runs on baz.com.

TO FIND OUT if @email is set for you or another person, type:

examine *personname

Note the use of the asterisk. 
*clothing
When your character is first created, it is not much to look at. Be
sure to set your description with the @desc command.

@describe me = You see a tall newspaperman with a button nose.

Type "look me" to see yourself.

Next, if you wish, set your gender with the @set command:

@set me = male

You can abbreviate most commands.

Next, you will probably want to read the "help moving" topic.
*moving
To move from room to room in PerlMUD, just type the direction in 
which you want to move. Usually the possible directions are mentioned
in the description of the room you are in. Typical exits
include north, south, east, west, and one-letter abbreviations 
of the above. You may see the message "Huh?" if a particular
exit is not available from the current room.

Example:

You are in the dining room. There is a door to the north.
n
You are in the hallway.

Next, you will probably want to read the "help talking" topic.
*talking
You will often encounter other players on the MUD. 
To converse with them, use the "say" command, which
can be abbreviated to a single " (double quotation mark).
For example:

say hello
You say hello.
"hello
You say hello.

If you want to express action or emotion, use
the emote command, which can be abbreviated to a
single : character. For example:

emote cries.
Bob cries.
:cries.
Bob cries.

To learn about conversing on specific topics, move on to 
"help topics". 
*topics
Often people want to discuss a subject of limited 
interest without leaving a public area. To make this
less annoying for everyone, "topics" are provided.
By default, everyone hears what is said on a topic,
but users can elect to "@leave" topics. 

Users speak on a topic by prefacing the topic
name with a comma:

,geek I love the gd graphics library.
You say, "I love the gd graphics library." <geek>
You can also emote on a topic using the ; character.

;geek blushes hotly.
Tom blushes hotly. <geek>

For more information, and examples, see "help @topic", 
"help @join" and "help @leave".

To learn about creating objects, move on to the "help building" topic.
*building
To create an object, use the @create command:

@create Can of Cheese-B-Gone
Can of Cheese-B-Gone has been created as #188.

Then describe the object. Try the following commands.
Note that abbreviations can be used:

@desc can = The can is of the usual ozone-destroying aerosol type.
look can
inventory
drop can
get can
@recycle can
To learn more, see the "help locking" topic, or move on to "help rooms".
*locking
You may wish to lock an object so that only certain people can pick it up, 
or lock an exit so that only certain people can move through it. Locks can 
refer to both people and objects. If you lock an object to a person, only 
that person can pick it up. Place an * in front of the person's name when
locking the object. If you lock an object to another object, the second 
object must be in the possession of a person attempting to use it. You can 
also build complicated locks using & (AND), | (OR), ! (NOT), and ( and ) 
to group expressions.

Got all that? Here are some examples:

@lock can = me
@lock can = !*Bob
@lock north = key
@lock south = !(bluekey | greenkey | redkey | prize)

To find out how to control what people see when a lock succeeds
or fails, see the "help messages" topic. To move on, see
the "help rooms" topic.
*messages
To control what a user sees when she fails to pass a lock, use @fail:

@fail north = You can't unlock the door. Guess you need a key.

To control what the audience sees, use @ofail. Note that the
player's name always appears first:

@ofail north = tries to open the door, but $s doesn't have a key.

$s is a substitution which inserts the correct pronoun. There are
several others; see the "help substitutions" topic for more information.

To control what a user sees when she successfully passes
a lock, use @success. To control what the audience sees,
use @osuccess.

To move on, see the "help rooms" topic.
*rooms
Eventually, you will want to create a home of your own for
your character. Try your own variation on the following
commands. 

@dig Palace of Wonderful Things
@link me = #XXX               (Type the number @dig reports to you, not XXX)
home
@desc here = Welcome to the Palace. Try the trapdoor down or press the button.
@open down;d = #0             (Or the number of a room set linkok on this MUD)
@desc down = A trapdoor in the floor beckons you downwards.
@open press button;button = home

Exits can have many alternate names, separated by semicolons.
"home" is a special destination which takes the player to the
home she is attached to by the @link command. "nowhere" is another
special destination which goes nowhere!

Note that you can use the @link command to change the destination
of the down exit, or any exit, at a later time. @link is also
useful to set the home of your objects. 
*flags
Every PerlMUD object can have one or more flags set.
You can use the @set command to set or clear a flag:

@set me = male
@set me = !dark

dark                   Contents of room not visible (except to "examine")
male                   Character is male (for pronoun substitutions)
female                 Character is female (for pronoun substitutions)
linkok                 OK for anyone to link exits TO this room
jumpok                 OK for anyone to teleport to this room
buildok                OK for anyone to link exits FROM this room
sticky                 This object goes home immediately when dropped
puzzle                 If set for room, force drop all on "home" or "@tele"
abode                  OK for anyone to set their home to this room
grand                  This room is huge; entrances, exits are silent
book                   Anyone can "sign" this object, adding text
once                   Used with book: a second signature replaces the first
wizard                 This player is a wizard (#1 is always a wizard)
expert                 If set, you must type a " before things you say
spy                    Tells you who really said something 
builder                The player is permitted to build things and rooms
creature               This player is actually a creature written in Perl
nocreatures            This room does not admit creatures
*substitutions
Commands like @fail, @ofail, @success, and @osuccess set messages
to be displayed when a player fails or succeeds in manipulating
an object or exit. To make sense, these messages must contain
the correct pronouns. The following substitutions are available,
and output the correct pronoun or name depending on the player's
flag settings and name:

Substitution    Name                  Outputs
%s              subjective            he, she, it, or name
%n              name                  name
%p              possessive            his, her, its, or name's
%a              absolute possessive   his, hers, its, or name's
%o              objective             him, her, it, or name name
%r              reflexive             himself, herself, itself, or name
%%              Percent sign          %

If the above substitutions are capitalized, the output will
also be capitalized.
*admin
The following administrative commands are available,
primarily for use by wizards. Also note that many ordinary
commands have far fewer restrictions when used by wizards.

@wall message               Sends a message to all connected players.

*last
The last command displays information about the most
recent login and logout times of a particular user.
See also the @tz command for a way to display these times

the @24 and @12 commands to set your preferred clock format.

Usage:

last playername
*@tz
The @tz command sets your time zone for convenience in
reading the output of the "last" command, and other commands
that output times and dates. You must specify an offset
in hours and minutes, with an optional minus sign. Time

The @wall command is used to send a message to
all players currently connected to the MUD.
@wall is available only to wizards.

Usage:

*@doing
The @doing command is used to set the message which appears
next to your character's name on the list output by the
who command.

(Rooms are created with the @dig command, exits are
created with the @open command, and players are
created with the @pcreate command.)

Usage:

@create objectname
*@topic
The @topic command is used to raise a topic, so people can
choose to '@leave' or '@join' that topic rather than hearing
everything that is said on the subject. By default, you are
always '@join'ed to all topics that come up.

Usage:
@topic gd
,gd I find the gd library very useful!
*@join
The @join command is used to indicate an interest in
one or more topics. By default, you see everything that
is said on any topic. If you have used the @leave command
to discard a topic, you can @join it later. If you have
used '@leave all' to stop following all topics, you can
@join individual topics or '@join all' to go back to the
default setting.

Usage:
@join gd,hex
@join all
*@leave
The @leave command is used to stop seeing comments on
one or more topics. By default, you see everything that
is said on any topic. If you have used the @leave command
to discard a topic, you can @join it later. If you have
used '@leave all' to stop following all topics, you can
@join individual topics or '@join all' to go back to the
default setting.

Usage:
@leave gd

to measure the impact of a particular user.

Usage:

@stats
@stats me
*@set
The @set command is used to set various flags on any 
object (including players, rooms, and exits). See
"help flags" for more information.

*@describe
The @describe command is used to set the description
that a player sees when looking at an object.

Usage:

@describe here = You are standing in a north-south hallway.
@describe me = Indifferent honest.
@describe north = To the north you can make out the shores of a distant lake.

*@rows
The @rows command sets the number of rows of scrollback
the WWW interface should display. You may wish to set this to 
a smaller value if your link is slow.

Usage:

@rows me = 20
*@name
The @name command is used to rename an existing
object. Only wizards can rename players.

Usage:

@name north = s;south
@name here = Castle OffwhiteSkull
*@chown
The @chown command is used to change the ownership of
an object. You may give any object you own to any other
player using @chown. 

Usage:

@chown object = player
*@pcreate
The @pcreate command is used to create a new character.
This command is available only to wizards. Character
names cannot contain spaces.

Usage:

@pcreate name = password
*@password
The @password command is used to set a new password
for a character. 

Usage:

@password foo
@password Jessica = kibitz27
*@teleport
The @teleport command is used to transport an object,

home is used as a destination, the object will go
to its own home, as was set by the @link command.

Usage:

@teleport #0
@teleport dog = home
*@link
The @link command is used to establish a home for an object. 
An object's home must be a room. Objects can be sent home under 
a variety of circumstances. In the case of exits, it sets a new
destination for the exit.

Usage:

@link me = here
@link dog = here
@link dog = #27

*@open
The @open command is used to open a new exit from this
room to a different room ID. The destination must be a
room. Every exit must have a destination, although it is 
possible to @lock an exit so that it never succeeds. Many 
synonyms for the exit's name can be provided to accommodate 
reasonable guesses on the player's part. The destination
can be changed later using the @link command.

Usage:

@open n;north;out = #322
*@fail
The @fail command is used to establish a failure message
which the player will see when unsuccessfully attempting
to get an object or use an exit. See also locking,
substitutions, @lock, @ofail, @success, @osuccess,
and @odrop.

Usage:

@fail north = The door won't open without a key.
*@ofail
The @ofail command is used to establish a failure message
which spectators in the room will see when a player 
unsuccessfully attempts to get an object or use an exit. 
See also locking, substitutions, @lock, @fail, @success, 
@osuccess, and @odrop.

Usage:

@ofail north = pounds senselessly on the door.
*@success
The @success command is used to establish a success message
which the player will see when successfully attempting
to get an object or use an exit. See also locking,
substitutions, @lock, @osuccess, @fail, @ofail, and @odrop.

Usage:

@success north = The key fits! You turn the lock and pass through.
*@osuccess
The @osuccess command is used to establish a success message
which spectators in the room will see when a player 
successfully attempts to get an object or use an exit. 
See also locking, substitutions, @lock, @success, @fail, 
@ofail, and @odrop.

Usage:

@osuccess north = passes through the door.
*@odrop
The @odrop command is used to establish a success message
which spectators in the room will see when a player 
drops the specified object. If the object is an exit,
the message will be displayed to other players in the
room the player has traveled into. See also locking, substitutions, 
@lock, @success, @osuccess, @fail, and @ofail.
*@lock
The @lock command is used to control which players
can get a particular object or pass through a particular 
exit. Locks can refer to both players and objects. If
a lock refers to a player, then that player can use
the object. If a lock refers to an object, then the
player can use it if the player is carrying the
specified key. Objects and players can be combined
using & (AND), | (OR), ! (NOT), and ( and )
(parentheses to group expressions).

If players are mentioned in the lock, it is crucial
that an * appear before the name of each player.

To clear a lock, place nothing on the right-hand side
of the = sign.

Usage:

@lock north = *jessica
@lock south = (!*roger) & blue key
*@boot
The @boot command is used to immediately disconnect
a particular player (for now). No permanent damage
is done to the user's character. Only wizards can
use this command.

Usage:

@boot player
*@clean
The @clean command is used to "clean up" the current 
room. Every object that does not have its home set
to the current room is immediately sent home, except
for currently connected players. Only the owner of the 
room or a wizard can use this command.

Usage:

@clean

*@find
The @find command is used to locate missing objects
by name. This is useful if you have forgotten the
id number of a newly created room.

Usage:

@find name
*@recycle
The @recycle command is used to recycle (destroy) an
object, reclaiming the space to be reused by a
new object. If the object contains other objects,
they are immediately dropped. If the object is a
room, room #0 is set as the new home of objects
residing in the recycled room. If there are exits
which lead to a recycled room, those exits are
directed to room #0. @recycle cannot be used directly 
on players, but wizards can use @toad first to
turn players into inanimate objects. 

@recycle cannot be undone. Be sure you want to recycle 
the object. This command cannot be abbreviated.

Usage:

@recycle object

*@toad
The @toad command is used to turn a character into a 
slimy toad (an inanimate object). The character's
possessions are recycled if no recipient is specified
to accept them. Only wizards can use this command.
This command cannot be abbreviated.

Usage:

@toad player
@toad player = recipient
*@shutdown
The @shutdown command is used to shut down the MUD,
disconnecting all current users and writing the 
database to disk. This command cannot be abbreviated.
*@reload
The @reload command is used to reload the mud source
code from mudlib.pl, after first writing the database
to disk. This often allows the installation of new
features without a shutdown, although of course bugs
in the changes you have made could crash the mud.
This command cannot be abbreviated.
*@dump
The @dump command is used to write the database to disk
immedately. Note that the server automatically writes the
database to disk at regular intervals. This command is
nonetheless useful when a particularly important action
has just been performed. Only wizards can use this
command. This command cannot be abbreviated.
*@gag
The @gag command allows you to completely ignore
another player. Use this command if you find you
simply can't stand them, no matter what. Use
examine me (not look me) to see who is on your 
gag list. 

Example:

@gag bob

See also: @ungag
*@ungag
The @ungag command is used to remove a gag placed with
the gag command. 

Example:

@ungag bob
Bob says, "it's oddly quiet in here."

See also: @gag
*rules
Nerdsholm is an extension of Tom's living room. Please
behave accordingly. 

When building yourself a home, ask for an entrance somewhere 
in the town so you can be added to the map. Please don't
add random, inconsistent exits. Beyond your front door, 
silly or illogical geography is perfectly OK.

Don't MUD while driving.
