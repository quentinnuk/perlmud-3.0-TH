name Elizabethan tearoom.
description This cosy, Tudor room is where all great adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...

On the opposite bank are trees, although the river is too quick to enable your swimming across. To the north is a curious, ornate wall, decorated in exotic, colourful designs of seemingly eastern origin. The wall is too tall to climb, as is the enormous hedge you find to the west, over the top of which you can just see what looks to be a belfry. The hedge stops on the edge of some trees, which are clumped together to the southwest.

description You stand among the aged trees of an orchard. Most of them are apple trees, but there is the occasional pear tree to add character. None bear fruit or leaves, however, which makes the scene unnaturally desolate. East and west from here are normal forests, and southeast is a sweet meadow. South and southwest is a river, and north is a yard, beyond which is an inn.

description You are pushing your way through the pine needles in a dense forest. Eastwards, the make-up of the forest changes to normal, deciduous trees. Northeast is a pasture, and north can be smelled a fuming swamp. In all other directions the pines get thicker, and you probably won't be able to get through.

In all southerly directions are pastures of soft, deep-green grass.

Southeast is a yard, belonging to an inn which can be seen just beyond it. South is a briar patch, and southwest the foothills of a more impressive mountain. Northwest is a deep valley, whose western slopes rise up to the foothills of a mountain more majestic still. The view is quite breathtaking.
