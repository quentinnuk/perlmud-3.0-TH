description This cosy, Tudor room is where all British Legends adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...

description You stand among the aged trees of an orchard. Most of them are apple trees, but there is the occasional pear tree to add character. None bear fruit or leaves, however, which makes the scene unnaturally desolate. East and west from here are normal forests, and southeast is a sweet meadow. South and southwest is a river, and north is a yard, beyond which is an inn.

name Pine forest.
description You are pushing your way through the pine needles in a dense forest. Eastwards, the make-up of the forest changes to normal, deciduous trees. Northeast is a pasture, and north can be smelled a fuming swamp. In all other directions the pines get thicker, and you probably won't be able to get through.

description You are wading through a fast-flowing, yet shallow, river, which originates from a fork in a much faster river to the southeast, and continues to the northwest. North is an orchard, which by the northeast has become a normal forest. East is a meadow, south of which is a gazebo. To the west lies a lush pasture, but southwest it is rough and desolate.

description You are stood by a river, flowing from the east to the west, where it disappears under a mountain. Foothills of the mountain are to the northwest, covered in forest which extends to the north of your current position, and become an orchard to the northeast. In all southerly directions are pastures of soft, deep-green grass.

Northwest is a deep valley, whose western slopes rise up to the foothills of a mountain more majestic still. The view is quite breathtaking.

North and south are the foot- hills of a pair of majestic mountains, and northeast is a deep valley.

name Rough pasture.
description You are stood in a bleak, rough pasture. This seems to be due to the presence of an evil wood to the east and south, for north and west are more pastures which seem to be far greener and lusher than here. South- west is a forest, and northeast there seems to be a fast-flowing river.

It has sadly fallen into disrepair, due to the constant battering of the elements, nestled as it is to the southeast of a towering mountain. To the east is a river bank, the river running north-south and forded to the southeast of where you now stand. To the southwest, running west from the ford, is a badly-paved road, beside which is an inn, the patrons of which stabled their horses here before The Land became what it is today.
