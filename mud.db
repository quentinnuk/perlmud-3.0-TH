description This cosy, Tudor room is where all great adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...

The scene is dominated by a huge cliff to the east, at the base of an awe-inspiring mountain which climbs away into the clouds, its foothills sweeping down into a steep escarpment covered in forest to the south. North is more forest, and west a dale. To the northeast there looks to be a railway cutting.

description You are stood inside a piece of history, a mausoleum which is far more ancient than its weatherbeaten exterior would indicate. Within the circular walls are the tombs of many, their names and heraldic designs carved into the stones in a language which was dead before Atlantis sank. The easiest exit from this eerie window on the past is to the northwest. On the floor, however, is carved an inscription in an archaic predecessor of your own language, which is readable. The floor and ceiling do not have entrances, but the tombs seem to.

description You are stood on a shelf in the rock, with a grand archway through into a passage to the northwest. This, however, is nothing compared to the spectacular sight to the east. You see that this is a cavern, light coming in by what seems to be a hole in the roof high above. Steps lead down to the base of a huge citadel, surrounded by a wall with forests beyond. To the northeast and southeast are two pastures, and from somewhere can be heard a running spring. The light reflecting from the citadel's marbled walls is so breathtaking you feel quite in awe.

description This cosy, Tudor room is where all great adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...
