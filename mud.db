description You are landed by some vicious rocks out at sea. A strong current flows past at alarming speed round the tattered, half-submerged wreckage of a galleon stuck forlornly on them. You can cross to the deck of the ship by going northwards, but its front half is underwater. To the east in the distance can be seen a beach and cliff. Quite a way to the south there looks to be a small island, dominated by a huge archway which stands astride it.
