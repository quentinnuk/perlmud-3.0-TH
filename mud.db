description This cosy, Tudor room is where all British Legends adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...

description You stand among the aged trees of an orchard. Most of them are apple trees, but there is the occasional pear tree to add character. None bear fruit or leaves, however, which makes the scene unnaturally desolate. East and west from here are normal forests, and southeast is a sweet meadow. South and southwest is a river, and north is a yard, beyond which is an inn. 
name Ancient orchard.

description You are pushing your way through the pine needles in a dense forest. Eastwards, the make-up of the forest changes to normal, deciduous trees. Northeast is a pasture, and north can be smelled a fuming swamp. In all other directions the pines get thicker, and you probably won't be able to get through.

description You find yourself on a badly-paved road, which continues to the east and west. North and northeast are the lower regions of a mountain, which rises up beyond the clouds. Southeast is a yard, belonging to an inn which can be seen just beyond it. South is a briar patch, and southwest the foothills of a more impressive mountain. Northwest is a deep valley, whose western slopes rise up to the foothills of a mountain more majestic still. The view is quite breathtaking.

description You are stood on a badly-paved road, which runs from the east to stop at a large wall constructed to the west. There is a narrow gap in this blockage, but it is so tight that if you wanted to go that way you'd have to drop everything to get through. North and south are the foot- hills of a pair of majestic mountains, and northeast is a deep valley.
