description This cosy, Tudor room is where all great adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...

On the opposite bank are trees, although the river is too quick to enable your swimming across. To the north is a curious, ornate wall, decorated in exotic, colourful designs of seemingly eastern origin. The wall is too tall to climb, as is the enormous hedge you find to the west, over the top of which you can just see what looks to be a belfry. The hedge stops on the edge of some trees, which are clumped together to the southwest.

description You are stood in the lower slopes of a majestic mountain beside a huge cliff to the north, which towers high above you. So rugged is the cliff that you cannot climb it, only gasp at the geological wonder of it all. The mountain slopes downwards to the south, and continues at the same level to the west.

There is a narrow gap in this blockage, but it is so tight that if you wanted to go that way you'd have to drop everything to get through.
