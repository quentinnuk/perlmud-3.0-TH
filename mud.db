description This cosy, Tudor room is where all British Legends adventures start. Its exposed oak beams and soft, velvet-covered furnishings provide it with the ideal atmosphere in which to relax before venturing out into that strange, timeless realm. A sense of decency and decorum prevails, and a feeling of kinship with those who, like you, seek their destiny in The Land. There are exits in all directions, each of which leads into a wisping, magical mist of obvious teleportative properties...

description You stand among the aged trees of an orchard. Most of them are apple trees, but there is the occasional pear tree to add character. None bear fruit or leaves, however, which makes the scene unnaturally desolate. East and west from here are normal forests, and southeast is a sweet meadow. South and southwest is a river, and north is a yard, beyond which is an inn.

Northeast is a pasture, and north can be smelled a fuming swamp. In all other directions the pines get thicker, and you probably won't be able to get through.
