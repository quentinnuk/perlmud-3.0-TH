2	?
3	Not during a fight!
4	Nothing happens.
5	?
6	?
7	?
8	Don't be silly, it takes years to invent something REALLY useful.
9	That's a very adventurous thing to say. Some people will try anything if
	they're especially desperate...
11	Work it out yourself, where's the fun in asking me if you get stuck?
12	I'm afraid nothing happens. Well now what are you going to do?
13	Oh that's quite all right, no need to apologise.
14	It's very polite of you to say please, but I can't help. Well, I
	won't...

18	Light it from a lit torch, you want to burn yourself or something?!
	Remember the firework code...
19	You can't do that, you're not a high enough level.
20	You're already invisible!
21	You're already visible!
22	You've just become invisible!
23	You've just become visible!
24	That spell only works on people, I'm afraid.
25	You can't look, you're blind, aren't you?
26	You NEED to wish when you're dumb, like you are! The only thing is, you
	can't speak the words...
27	You can't make the necessary hand movements to execute the spell
	in such a small room as this.
28	You are cured of all your disablements!
29	The spell won't work if you're dumb yourself.
30	The spell won't work if you're crippled yourself.
31	The spell won't work if you're blind yourself.
32	The spell won't work if you're deaf yourself.
33	If you weren't a wiz you'd have just been struck dumb!
34	You have been struck dumb magically!
35	The spell doesn't work, and you are struck dumb yourself!
36	If you weren't a wiz you'd have just been crippled!
37	You have been crippled magically!
38	The spell doesn't work, and you are crippled yourself!
39	If you weren't a wiz you'd have just gone blind!
40	You have gone blind magically!
41	The spell doesn't work, and you go blind yourself!
42	If you weren't a wiz you'd have just gone deaf!
43	You have gone deaf magically!
44	The spell doesn't work, and you go deaf yourself!
45	There's not enough in the swamp for me to oblige.
46	You need to retaliate with a weapon.
47	You're not fighting anyone to retaliate against!
48	There is a sudden burning sensation in your chest, which grows
	sharply in intensity and spreads to your throat. Coughing and
	choking, you fall to your knees as it worsens, and you feel wracking
	pains all through your body. Your eyesight grows blurred, and you
	start to froth at the mouth. At once, your eyes roll upwards, your
	tongue flops out, and you keel over backwards, dead...
49	In an attempt to keep the game uncorrupted, you have been killed.
67	This firestone GLOWS! You can't light other stuff from it!
68	The firestone glows, and you can't stop it...
88	You swing your mighty axe, and the next moment the portal is but
	matchwood, and the doorway passable. Your axe breaks too, however,
	due to the force of the chop. Delinquent vandal, I don't know...
90	Use an axe if you want to break down a door. You don't expect them
	to be made out of balsa, do you?
100	The door creaks slowly open.
101	The door swings shut.
109	Your brand is now lit.
110	Your brand is now doused.
115	Ok, hope you're hungry!
131	The stick is now alight.
132	Nice try, but the sticks here are too thick for an old boy-scout
	trick like that...
139	Ugh! It is foul! Hastily you stop drinking, but too late. Everything
	swims about you and you feel giddy. You fall unconcious to the floor.
158	Drinking stuff in this land rarely has any effect. Now is no exception.
171	ZZZzzz...
177	This is a MAGIC fire so you can't extinguish it! How do you think it
	keeps burning all the time?
183	The door is already open.
184	The door is locked shut, and needs keys to open it.
185	The door is already unlocked.
186	The key grates in the lock and unlocks the door.
187	The door is already closed.
188	The key grates in the lock and locks the door shut.
189	The door is already locked.
242	You have to be holding something alight to ignite something.
245	You can examine 'til your heart's content, you won't find anything
	special. Heavens, if I let folk examine things they'd spend the whole
	game doing it!
307	The torch isn't lit so you can't light anything from it...
308	The torch isn't lit so you can't melt anything with it...
328	You give them a great big sloppy kiss.
344	Think of something else sesaME...
365	You take a great draught, and a power swells through your body. The
	liquid has a taste quite unlike any you have tasted before, and you
	feel fully invigorated. Then, quite by surprise, the empty bottle
	vanishes!
370	You don't find anything.
381	Far too difficult, I'm afraid, there are too many branches about. You
	have to give up.
382	And very regal you look too! Shame you don't get any points for it,
	though..!
391	You have to be carrying a lit brand if you want to light anything.
431	The cat tries to get out of your way but you graunch its head in.
432	It's dead for heaven's sake! They only have nine lives you know...
433	The cat isn't hungry. It's been living off enchanted sugar mice for
	the past hundred and fifty years...
436	This is an enchanted forest. Hence, virtually every tree resists your
	chops as if you'd been using an axe of wet paper. There might be a few
	which you CAN chop down though, if you can find them...
443	Your hand gets cacked up with red goo from the cat's corpse...
444	The cat mioaws.
473	Oh my god, that's disgusting! I can't let you do that in THIS Land!
486	What?
488	The usually complacent cat suddenly becomes a spitting, biting,
	clawing killer!
504	?
505	If you want to lock it, try using a key.
519	How the hell do you expect a dead cat to eat anything?!
540	You know what happens to people who do that, don't you..?
548	I already told you what it said!
552	You give them an enormous big hug!
558	Light it with what? If you want to burn it with a torch, say so!
559	Unlock the door with what? If you want to unlock the door with keys,
	why not say so? Just to please me?
560	Mere curiosity won't kill THIS cat, I'm afraid!
573	The clear, coloured liquid becomes cloudy when the medicine is added. Soon
	you have added all the medicine and the container disintigrates. You
	are now left with the potion only. Is it safe to drink..?
574	You take a gulp, but nothing seems to happen. The level of liquid in the
	vial doesn't seem to lower.
575	You drink them both, and nothing happens. Maybe you should have mixed
	them first?
577	OK, the mobiles are immobile.
578	The mobiles are mobile.
588	With what do you want to light the torch? Say things in full,
	bedlamite!
590	The force isn't with you...
596	You can't dig here; wait until some tunnel or something collapses if
	you REALLY want to get your hands dirty.
637	It's still alive! Kill it first, you moron - don't you know
	ANYTHING about eating cats?
638	MMmm, yum-yum! That tasted good!
640	One doesn't cook cats, one eats them raw. I thought EVERYONE knew
	that...
650	Your spell doesn't work, but the power of the magic involved makes you
	fall asleep yourself instead!
654	3.14159, or thereabouts.
696	Limbo is nowhere, so there is nowhere to go when you leave the game.
714	Hammering things may be fun, but apart from that there's no effect.
724	It comes up heads.
725	It comes up tails.
739	Yes?
755	Your spell doesn't work.
756	Your spell worked!
762	OK, I've flushed out the last object you typed and all your pronouns.
764	That's let the cat out of the bag!
765	You start feeling queasy all of a sudden...
771	The flame catches hold, and burns the container to ashes, along
	with everything inside it, at quite some considerable speed (magic?).
	Well that was clever, wasn't it?
778	The syntax is FEED <creature> WITH <food> .
780	You reach into the fire but its magical flames are too hot, and you
	are forced to withdraw hastily before you are burned!
781	The magical flame consumes anything put in it.
782	The flames flicker around, and you can't see anything in them.
792	There's not enough room to swing a cat here.
793	There's enough room, and the cat swings quite well.
809	It doesn't make much difference with the sack, opened or closed.
	Nothing will fall out anyway, and it's airtight.
810	It's already open, why don't you read the description?
811	The bag creaks open slowly.
812	The bag is now closed.
813	It's already closed.
814	Not when you're berserk!
816	The bag is closed.
823	Yale, union, lf.
826	There's not enough room down the toilet.
828	The basin is fixed down so you can't get it.
829	Better to be safe than sorry!
830	Not that old, "smash the cistern" joke again...
831	The toilet flushes.

834	I suppose you must have a reason for being sick, but there's no
	advantage in it. Still, it'd be a dull world if we were all the same,
	eh?
836	You put it in, but it's too heavy to be carried off by the current so
	you take it out again.
845	You have to be a hero or heroine before you are experienced enough to
	wield an axe.
846	You can guarantee that some bright spark is going to type that just to
	show how clever it is to swear at a dumb program.
849	Don't forget it's wizard locked...
862	That was refreshing!
871	A second or so later, as you wipe the vomit from your chin, you feel
	much better.
873	You can't eat that!
874	By 'consume' I don't know whether you mean eat or drink. Since people
	try some weird things in The Land, I'd appreciate your saying which
	you meant to do explicitly, please.
879	I'm afraid you don't seem to be able to at the moment!
882	Your spell works, but the power of the magic you have invoked causes you
	to fall into a deep slumber...
888	You have to say what it is you're writing in, followed by a comma, then
	the message you wish to write.
889	OK, you're in a superseded version now.
907	Your stomach turns over and you feel quite giddy. You are feeling
	very unwell, in fact.
914	You feel much better for the medicine, but it makes you feel EVER so
	tired...>YAWN<...
955	Clouds are beginning to gather in the sky.
956	It has started to rain.
957	The skies clear, and it stops raining.
958	OK, it's winter...
959	It has started to snow.
960	The skies clear, and it stops snowing.
968	Your spell doesn't work. All of a sudden, you feel drowsy...ZZZ...zzz...
969	If you want to eat it you'll have to pick it up first.
970	The snake bites its fangs into your leg! You feel the poison flood
	through your body...
971	As you reach to pick it up, the viper sinks its fangs into your arm!
	You withdraw it, sucking at the wound, but it seems too late to stop
	the poison infusion taking effect...
974	It's summer!
975	Cooked snake? Pick it up first then...
976	It ignores you. It's a full adder...
973	The viper suddenly bites deep into your foot with its fangs! You
	manage to shake it off, but the poison is now in your blood...
979	Fighting is forbidden.
980	Fighting is allowed.
981	The cat is male, and it'll be buggered if it'll let you do THAT!
982	Well you chopped it up. Fun, eh?
1500	You're not in a clear enough space to let off a rocket, pick somewhere
	out in the open more.
1501	It skeets up into the sky, leaving a blood-red trail behind it. You
	watch, breathless...
1502	*High up in the sky you see an enormous red

1503	Your sparkler starts to sparkle!
1504	It's already lit! It's sparkling away quite happily!
1505	It's a magic sparkler, it won't go out...
1506	You hear a pin drop.
1507	In the distance you hear a pin drop.
