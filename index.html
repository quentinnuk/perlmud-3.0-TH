</p>

<h2>What is PerlMUD?</h2>
PerlMUD is a MultiUser Dimension (MUD), a text-based
environment that allows multiple users to converse,
explore, and interact. PerlMUD is written in Perl 5
and is highly compatible with the well-known TinyMUD
command set, which provides a friendly interface
to your online environment.
<p>
Complete Perl source code is included. Administrators can easily
extend the PerlMUD system by writing additional
Perl code.
<h2>What's new and nifty about version 3.0?</h2>
Version 3.0 is 100% backwards compatible with previous releases
and the databases that they produced.
<p>
Version 3.0 has two major new features:
<ul>
<li><em>Topics</em> offer some of the best features of IRC,
while respecting the style and personality of MUD systems.
Topics provide a way to hold open conversations on specific topics
in a crowded MUD room while giving others the opportunity to
opt out if they choose. See "help topics" for more information.
<li>The new <em>@reload</em> command allows the administrator
to reload new PerlMUD source code <em>without shutting down the mud</em>.
Beginning in version 3.0, the vast majority of the code and
configuration options are located in the file <code>mudlib.pl</code>.
Essentially all of the MUD's behavior can be changed "on the fly"
with this feature. Administrators in production environments can use
this feature to activate new changes without restarting, after testing 
them in a separate test MUD environment. See <code>help @reload</code>
and the mudlib.pl and mud source files for more information.
</ul>
<P>
<h4>What Was New In Version 2.1</h4>
Version 2.1 lets the MUD administrator decide
whether new users should be allowed to build.
You control this by setting the $allowBuild
flag (in the configuration section at the top
of the mud source file) to 1 for yes or 0
for no. 
<p>
Version 2.1 also lets the MUD admin
decide whether users should be permitted to 
use the @emit command, which says things
without prefixing them with the user's name.
Set the $allowEmit flag to 1 or 0 to control
this feature.
<p>
Version 2.1 adds the @gag and @ungag
commands. @gag person prevents you from
hearing anything that person says. (Beware:
you won't see them coming or going either.)
@ungag person lets you hear that person
again. Type <code>examine me</code> to find
out who is on your personal gag list 
if you have forgotten.
<p>
Finally, Version 2.1 writes a new database
format which should not need to be changed
again. The source code of version 2.1 has
been rewritten to use an array of objects
(hashes), instead of separate arrays for
each characteristic of an object, and the
new database format stores attribute-value
pairs. This will make it <strong>much easier
to customize your mud server code</strong> in
a way that is compatible with new releases
of PerlMUD.
<h3>What Was New in Version 2.0</h3>

Version 2.0 of PerlMUD includes a simple, effective
web-based user interface that <strong>any</strong>
web browser can use. Browsers that support frames
get the best interface, with automatic refresh
of the output frame, but other browsers can also
use the system; even lynx can handle it! 
This simple web-based client <strong>is compatible
with most firewalls</strong> if the user has
web access through a proxy server.
<strong>PerlMUD acts as a simple web server
in its own right. This makes it drastically
more efficient than CGI-based chat solutions.</strong>
<p>
A Java-based client, which is comparable to
specialized mud clients in its friendliness, 
is also included.
<p>

<h2>What do I need to run a PerlMUD server?</h2>

You need access to a computer that offers Perl 5.001 or better. 
If you are still using Perl 4.0, you need to upgrade.
<p>
Most Unix systems offer Perl. PerlMUD may or may not work for you
under Windows. PerlMUD will run just fine under MacOS X.
If you do use the software
with Windows, you will need to provide a compatible alternative
to the Unix <code>sendmail</code> program, or give out
accounts manually. Your input on NT experiences is welcome.
<p>
MacPerl can apparently run PerlMUD with some success on MacOS Classic; 
again, more input on this is welcome.
<p>
PerlMUD runs without problems under Linux and other
common Unix operating systems with Perl 5 installed.

<h2>Where can I get PerlMUD?</h2>

Point your web browser at the following URL:
<p>
<code><a href="http://www.boutell.com/perlmud/perlmud-3.0.tar.gz">
http://www.boutell.com/perlmud/perlmud-3.0.tar.gz</a></code>
<p>
Save the file to disk.

You will need to issue these commands after the download:

<pre>
uncompress perlmud-3.0.tar.gz 
tar -xf perlmud-3.0.tar
cd perlmud-3.0
</pre>

The above commands are intended for Unix, and will also work at the
terminal prompt in MacOS X.

<h2>How do I set up PerlMUD?</h2>

Once you unpack the program, as shown above, you must 
configure it. The Perl source code is in the file "mud". <strong>You will 
need to edit the <code>$dataDirectory</code> setting at the top of that
file to match the directoy where PerlMUD 3.0 hs been placed.</strong>
<p>
Perform the following steps:
<ul>
<li>1. Using a text editor, such as vi, set <code>$dataDirectory</code> in 
the file <code>mud</code> to point to the path
where you have installed PerlMUD 3.0.
<li>2. Copy the file "minimal.db" to "mud.db".
<li>3. Set <code>$serverName</code> in <code>mudlib.pl</code> to the name 
you would prefer to see in the titles of various web pages produced
by the simple web interface.
<li>4. Set <code>$hostName</code> in <code>mudlib.pl</code> to the Internet host
name of the server. Example: if your PerlMUD server runs on
the machine <code>www.mycompany.com</code>, then put
<code>www.mycompany.com</code> here. <strong>You cannot
simply make up a name --</strong> if you don't know
what the machine is called, ask the administrator.
This information is used to give new users instructions
to connect to the MUD when they receive accounts via email.
<li>5. Optionally, change <code>$tinypPort</code> (if you do not want to 
use port 4096) and code>$httpPort</code> (if you do not want to use
port 4196) in <code>mudlib.pl</code>. The first is used for telnet and java client
access; the second is used by the simple web interface.
</ul>
<p>
Now, to start the MUD, type (under Unix):
<pre>
perl mud &
</pre>
In the beginning, there are only two objects: 
The Void (a room, object #0) and Admin (a player,
object #1).
<p>
Wait a few seconds for the mud to start, then
type the following commands (under Unix):
<pre>
telnet localhost 4096
connect admin initial
</pre>
Once you have logged into the admin character,
type "help" for more information. You will find
the tutorial topics useful to get you started
with PerlMUD administration. 
<p>
<blink><strong>SECURITY ALERT:</strong></blink> 
change your password using the @password command 
before you let the public know your server exists!
Try "help @password" while logged into the mud
for further instructions. (Most administrative
commands begin with an @ sign.)

<h2>How do I add more rooms and objects?</h2>
Type "help building" to read about how to create
objects; type "help rooms" for information about
creating new rooms and exits between them. Type
"help admin" for a list of administrative commands.

<h2>How will my users access PerlMUD?</h2>

Your users can apply for accounts
<strong>right on the web,</strong> by accessing
the simple web server <strong>built in</strong>
to your PerlMUD system! The URL to use is
<code>http://yourhost.com:4196/</code>, where
<code>yourhost.com</code> should be replaced
with the hostname of the machine you are running
your PerlMUD server on.
<h2>How do I restrict access?</h2>
<h3>Running a Completely Private System</h3>
The simplest solution is to create an <strong>empty file</strong>
called <code>allowed.txt</code> in your
PerlMUD directory. This will tell PerlMUD not
to let <em>anyone</em> apply for an account
online. Instead, you will use the
@pcreate command when logged in as the
admin user, to create accounts manually:
<pre>
@pcreate name = password
</pre>
You'll also want to edit the document
<code>home.html</code> to no longer link
to the special "public applications" URL
of the server ( <code>/apply</code> ).
<h3>Open Access from Only One Organization</h3>
If you wish, you can allow users whose email
addresses are in a specific domain to apply
freely for accounts without any extra effort
on your part. Just create a file called
<code>allowed.txt</code> in your PerlMUD
directory, and put the names of domains 
and/or individual email addresses that
<em>are</em> allowed to apply for accounts.
<p>
Here's a simple example:
<pre>
boutell.com
</pre>
If your allowed.txt file contains the
line above, then all users with addresses
<em>ending in</em> boutell.com are permitted
to apply for accounts.
<p>
Here's another example:
<pre>
boutell.com
smith@jones.com
</pre>
This allowed.txt file would permit anyone
at boutell.com, or the specific email address
smith@jones.com, to apply for an account.
<h3>Locking Out A Few Bad Apples</h3>
The last option, which public servers will
want to use, is to simply lock out "bad apples"
by domain or by email address. <em>Each time
a new user is given an account,</em> a line
is written to the file <code>accounts.log</code>,
giving the account name and the email address
for that user. You can use this information
to decide who must be locked out of the system.
<p>
Just create a file called
<code>lockouts.txt</code> in your PerlMUD
directory, and put the names of domains 
and/or individual email addresses that
<em>are NOT</em> allowed to apply for accounts.
<p>
Here's a simple example:
<pre>
ugly.com
</pre>
If your allowed.txt file contains the
line above, then all users with addresses
<em>ending in</em> ugly.com are NOT
permitted to apply for accounts.
<p>
Here's another example:
<pre>
ugly.com
jerk@jones.com
</pre>
This allowed.txt file would not permit
anyone at ugly.com, or the specific
email address jerk@jones.com, to apply
for an account under any circumstances.
<H4>How do I know where a jerk is coming from?</h4>
<em>Each time a new user is given an account,</em> a line
is written to the file <code>accounts.log</code>,
giving the account name and the email address
for that user. You can use this information
to decide who must be locked out of the system. 

<h2>How do my users log on?</h2>
There are three ways to access PerlMUD servers.
<p>
The simplest, although the least attractive, is
to connect through <strong>any web browser</strong>
by accessing the URL <code>http://yourhost.com:4196/</code>.
<p>
This simple interface is easy to access, but users
who are familiar with <code>telnet</code> programs
will prefer to telnet to <code>port 4096</code>
on the server machine, or use a mud client program
such as <a href="http://www.muq.org/~hawkeye/tf/">TinyFugue</a> for
Unix or one of the numerous Mac and Windows mud clients.
<p>
The third approach, which is as easy to understand
as the web interface, as fast as the telnet interface,
and more attractive than either, is to use the 
<a href="client.html">Java PerlMUD client</a>. 
The Java client is far more user-friendly
than a telnet session, and it appears as an
integral part of the web browser.
<h2>What if my users are behind a firewall?</h2>
They will get best results using the 
simple web interface, which is accessed at
the following URL: <code>http://yourhost.com:4196/</code>
<p>
Of course, <code>yourhost.com</code> must be replaced
by the name of the host on which your PerlMUD server
is running. 
<p>
Some users with firewalls may also have telnet access 
if they are permitted to log into a special "gateway"
machine first.
<p>
<h2>Is PerlMUD stable?</h2>
Version 3.0 of PerlMUD has withstood many years
of daily use, including an online/real world wedding 
ceremony with over 50 active participants.
Complete online help is included, with tutorial topics
for new users and admins as well as a command-by-
command reference.

<h2>Does PerlMUD require a lot of memory?</h2>

PerlMUD is RAM-based, so the database resides
in virtual memory. A PerlMUD system with only
two objects occupies about 2.3 megabytes of
virtual memory, but each additional object
requires very little space. My system, with 205 objects 
and several players logged on, occupies about 3 megabytes
of virtual memory. 

<h2>Is PerlMUD efficient?</h2>

PerlMUD requires very little CPU. PerlMUD wakes up
only when a user issues a command, so typical CPU
use is near zero.

<h2>Is PerlMUD extensible?</h2>

Yes, by the MUD administrator. The entire MUD is written
in the extremely friendly Perl programming language,
so adding new commands is straightforward. 

<h2>What about programming documentation?</h2>

The code is reasonably well-commented.

<h2>How do I customize the web pages PerlMUD displays?</h2>

Just edit the HTML files accepted.html, application.html, 
and home.html.

<h2>Do I have to register PerlMUD?</h2>

No, PerlMUD was released under the MIT license on
July 4th, 2011.
