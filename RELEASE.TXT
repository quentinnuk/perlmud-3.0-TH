Version 3.0, 12/04/02: new features
including topics ("help topics") and
the ability to reload the source code
of the mud without shutting down the
mud, provided the code does not crash,
of course ("help @reload").

Version 2.12, 2/8/97: The @stats command
was broken in version 2.1; in that version
or 2.11 it would crash the MUD. This has
been fixed.

Version 2.11, 2/6/97: SO_LINGER is no longer
being shut off for HTTP connections. This should
be helpful on the platforms that previously
could not use the HTTP interface (SunOS
in particular had problems). Also, HTTP
sockets are being set non-blocking again.

Version 2.1, 2/4/97: the database is now stored
as a collection of objects with attribute-value
pairs. This makes it easier to read and modify the 
code, and makes custom versions of the mud much
more database-compatible with each other. You can
easily add attributes without conflicting with 
future official versions of PerlMUD. 

Also, an @gag command has been added. @gag person
to avoid listening to a person who annoys you.
Beware: you won't see them coming or going either.
@ungag person to remove a gag. examine me to 
find out who is currently on your personal
gag list.

The $hostName configuration variable has been
added in the configuration area. This
must be set to the Internet host name of
your server. It is used to provide account
applicants with complete login instructions
via email.

Finally, two new flags have been added in the
configuration area:

$allowEmit: determines whether the @emit
command is available. @emit says things
without prefixing them with your name.

$allowBuild: determines whether new users
are allowed to create objects, dig rooms,
and so on. Set this off *before* you first
run PerlMUD 2.1 if you want the setting to
affect all of your current users once you
have upgraded. The new 'builder' flag
determines whether an individual can build.

Version 2.02, 1/28/97: jump scrolling now works
properly in the frames client under MSIE
(it worked in Netscape before). 

Version 2.01, 1/28/97: applying online for an account
name containing uppercase letters is now working.
